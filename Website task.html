<p> I am currently learning to code with 
    <a href= "https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/">  </a>  . Going over everything from how the 
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why... </p>

<ol> 
    <li> You can understand what is going on 'under the hood' </li>
    <li> Not have to rely on someone else for a quick prototype</li>
    <li> It's fun!</li>
</ol>

<div> 
<h3> <i> <b>What do you need to create a website? </b></i> </h3>
</div>
Not much!

<ul>
    <li> A computer (always a good start)</li>
    <li> A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
    <li>A web browser (I am using chrome) </li>
    <li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files </li>


 </ul>
